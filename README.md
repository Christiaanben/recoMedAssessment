# recoMedAssessment
Provides an API end point that will calculate the total number of business seconds between two given times. A business second is defined as any whole second that elapses after 08:00 and before 17:00 during a weekday (Monday - Friday) that is not a public holiday in the Republic of South Africa. The end point must support only list GET requests and must take two parameters: start_time and end_time. Parameter values will be in ISO-8601 format. You are guaranteed that start_time will be before end_time. The end point must respond with only a single integer value for successful requests or a suitable error message string for failed requests.
